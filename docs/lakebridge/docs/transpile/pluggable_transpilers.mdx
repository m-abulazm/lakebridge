Lakebridge _pluggable_ transpilers
---

`Lakebridge` transpiles source code using _pluggable_ transpilers.
They are pluggable in the sense that:
 - their code sits outside of the `lakebridge` code base
 - there can be more than 1 installed, although as of writing, `lakebridge` can only use 1 at a given point in time
 - `lakebridge` knows nothing about them until they are discovered at runtime

Communication between `lakebridge` and a transpiler is achieved using `LSP`, see for example [this starter](https://github.com/databrickslabs/lakebridge-plugin-starters/tree/python-sdk/python) to learn more about how this works.

This document describes how `lakebridge` discovers and runs transpilers.

Although one could _in theory_ run a transpiler without access to the Databricks platform, `lakebridge` requires a valid Databricks install.
Lakebridge leverages this by expecting transpilers to reside in the `.databricks` folder hierarchy, as follows:


```
.databricks/
├── labs/
│   ├── lakebridge-transpilers/
│   │   ├── morpheus/
│   │   ├── lakebridge-community-transpiler/
│   │   ├── some-3rd-party-transpiler/
```

Each transpiler resides in its own dedicated sub-directory, whose name can be anything (although avoiding spaces is recommended). It itself comprises 2 folders:
```
.
├── lib/
│   ├── config.yml
│   ├── <transpiler code>
├── state/
│   ├── version.json
```

A transpiler `lib` subdirectory _must_ comprise a `config.yml` file that follows the following structure:

```yaml
lakebridge:
  version: 1 # mandatory, _must_ equal 1
  name: <name of the transpiler> # mandatory, can be different from the folder name
  dialects: # this section is mandatory and cannot be empty
    - <sql dialect 1> # such as 'oracle' - it is recommended to leverage existing dialect names
    - <sql dialect 2>
    - ...
    - <sql dialect _n_>
  environment: # this section is optional, variables are set prior to launching the transpiler
    <name 1>: <value 1>
    <name 2>: <value 2>
    ...
    <name _n_>: <value _n_>
  command_line: # this section is mandatory and cannot be empty, it is used to launch the transpiler
    - <executable> # such as 'java', or 'python'
    - <argument 1> # such as '-jar'
    - ...
    - <argument _n_>
custom: # this section is optional, it is passed to the transpiler at startup
    <key 1>: <value 1> # can be pretty much anything
```

Databricks provides 2 transpilers: _Morpheus_, its advanced transpiler, and _RCT_ (Lakebridge Community Transpiler).
These transpilers are installed by `lakebridge` itself as part of running the `install-transpile` command, as follows:
 - the latest _Morpheus_ is fetched from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/), and installed at `.databricks/labs/lakebridge-transpilers/morpheus/`.
 - the latest _RCT_ is fetched from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), and installed at `.databricks/labs/lakebridge-transpilers/lakebridge-community-transpiler/`.

Installing 3rd party transpilers is the responsibility of their provider.

When `lakebridge` is configured, it scans the `lakebridge-transpilers` directory, and collects available source dialects and corresponding transpilers, such that the user can configure them as wished.

When a user runs the _transpile_ command, `lakebridge` sets the working directory to the configured transpiler, appends the configured environment variables, and runs the configured command line.

The transpiler is an LSP Server i.e. it listens to commands from _lakebridge_ until it is instructed to exit.

Manually installing a transpiler
---

There are situations where an installer may fail: security rules preventing downloads, pre-releases...
Following the above steps, it is straightforward to manually install a transpiler, by:
 - creating the transpiler folder in the `.databricks/labs/lakebridge-transpilers/` directory
 - creating the `lib` and `state` sub-folders
 - creating a `config.yml` file in the `lib` folder (see details above)
 - creating a `version.json` file in the `state` folder with content like:
   ```json
   {"version": "v1.3.7", "date": "2025-03-17-15:02:31Z"}
   ```
